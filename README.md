## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Flex
- [ArrowJS](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I am using code mentor to get some experience with ArrowJS. It uses vanilla html/css/js to make components in static html files. Only uses 2kb and is loaded via cdn.

This is the entry point for where arrowJs code is added to the static html document.

```html
<body>
    <main class="app">
    </main>
  <div class="attribution">
    Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>. 
    Coded by <a href="#">Your Name Here</a>.
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="./component/age-calculator.js"></script>
  <script type="module">
    import {app} from './component/age-calculator.js';
    const appElement = document.querySelector(".app");

    app(appElement)
  </script>
</body>
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
